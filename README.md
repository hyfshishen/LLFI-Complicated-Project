# LLFI-Complicated-Project

HPCCG is a simple conjugate gradient benchmark code for a 3D chimney domain from Mantevo benchmark suite.

By execute following commands, an executable binary **test_HPCCG** can be successfully generated by g++ compiler provided by OS.
```
# To compile project
cd HPCCG & make
# To remove compiled binaries and other dynamic links
make clean
```

Have a try to do the followings:
- Preprocess and compile by LLVM.
- Perform FI via LLFI.
